This is HackMaster 2.0. It's a turn based card game in which you play cards for a cost of resource. Cards are used for either upgrading, defending, or attacking. The cards cost resources, and resources are incremented by resource rate each time it's the players turn (every second time). 

The single player option is functional. The game is limited but works. Not all the buttons will lead somewhere but the ones pressed will. 
Playing cards is dependent on the resource, so if you don't have the resources you won't be able to play the card (there is nothing right now that indicated that you can't play a card.


## Andriod studio 
Build once, if build doesn't work go to build->clean build. Then hit play.
If you can't run the simulator got on tools->android->sync gradle.
